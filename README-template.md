## Overview

Hello, My name is M.Wali(wali1209 => GitHUB username).
This my first FrontEndMentor project and this is also the first time I completed project using REACT + TypeScript.
I didn't use that ![image](./images/image-qr-code.png) instead I use [QR-Code-API](https://goqr.me/api/) to generate QR Code with given text.
Project Dependencies:
REACT
TypeScript
styled-components

### What I learned

Tried to code with React and TypeScript for the first time and learn lot of new thing but project was very small, So looking forward to for the bigger projects.
